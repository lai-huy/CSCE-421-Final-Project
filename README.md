# CSCE 421 Final Project

The code was written in `code.ipynb` without using the starter code.
After finding out it is required to use starter code, the code was transfered to `finalcode.ipynb`

Since the TA approved the use of notebooks, the parser was removed, but structure of notebook is similar to starter code.

`predicitionXGBoost.csv` holds our best sumbition, but the other CSV were used to compare models.
